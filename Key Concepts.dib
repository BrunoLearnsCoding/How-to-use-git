What is the differences between a **tree** and a **commit** in **Git**:

1. **Tree**:
    - A **tree** is a fundamental Git object that represents the **directory structure** within a repository.
    - It links together a set of **blobs** (which contain the actual file content) with their corresponding **names**, **permissions**, and **paths**.
    - Think of a tree as a snapshot of a specific directory state at a particular point in time.
    - Trees are essential for organizing files and directories within the repository.

2. **Commit**:
    - A **commit** is another type of Git object that serves as a **snapshot** of your project at a certain moment.
    - A commit consists of several components:
        - **Root Tree**: The tree that represents the entire directory structure of the project at that point.
        - **Author**: Information about who made the commit.
        - **Committer**: Information about who committed the changes.
        - **Timestamps**: When the commit was made.
        - **Commit Message**: A description of the changes made in the commit.
        - **Commit Parents**: References to one or more previous commits (except for the initial/root commit).
    - Commits allow Git to track the history of changes and provide a way to navigate through different versions of your project.

3. **Relationship**:
    - A commit object **references** a tree. It associates metadata (such as author, committer, timestamps) with that tree.
    - Multiple commit objects can reference the **same tree** if the state of files in each commit is identical.
    - When you run `git ls-tree` on a commit SHA, it automatically uses the tree SHA referenced by that commit.

In summary, while a **tree** links blobs with their names and permissions, a **commit** connects a root tree with additional metadata, effectively creating a snapshot of your project at a specific time. üå≥üìÇüîç
