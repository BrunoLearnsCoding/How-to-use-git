# Git Merges

Merge is a very important concept in git. Different situations could lead to a different type of merge :


There are different merge strategies which are selected by git according to the situation in which the merge occures.

Certainly! When merging branches in Git, you can choose from various strategies based on your project's needs. Here are some common Git merge strategies:

1. **Fast Forward Merge (FF)**:
   - Used when merging a branch into another branch.
   - If the target branch has no new commits since the source branch was created, Git performs a fast-forward merge.
   - The commit history remains linear.
   - Suitable for simple scenarios where no conflicts arise.

2. **Recursive Merge (ORT)**:
   - Default strategy for pulling or merging one branch.
   - Resolves two heads using a 3-way merge algorithm.
   - Creates a merged tree of common ancestors and uses it as the reference tree.
   - Detects and handles merges involving renames.
   - Can be customized with options like `-X ours` (favoring our version) or `-X theirs` (favoring their version).

3. **Resolve Merge**:
   - Uses a 3-way merge algorithm to combine changes from both branches.
   - Requires manual conflict resolution if changes overlap.
   - Suitable for straightforward merges.

4. **Octopus Merge**:
   - Merges more than two branches simultaneously.
   - Rarely used due to complexity and potential conflicts.

5. **Subtree Merge**:
   - Combines changes from a subdirectory of one branch into another.
   - Useful for managing external dependencies.

Choose the strategy that best fits your project's requirements and workflow¹²⁴.
